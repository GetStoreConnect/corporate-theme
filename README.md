# Corporate Theme

This is a multi-purpose theme, ideal for corporate, B2B, or services companies.

## Directory Structure

This theme has a specific folder structure. Some folders may be empty, but they need to remain part of the theme structure as they are not overridden or used for new templates.

Also, it has been developed using the [Base Theme](https://github.com/GetStoreConnect/base-theme) as a boilerplate. The Corporate theme doesn't contain all the base theme structure, instead, we only include those customised, modified and new templates, snippets, variables or translations. Feel free to create a brand new theme using the base theme.

## Theme Installer

The theme installer is in your Salesforce org, where you must upload this theme as a zip file. Before uploading, remove the .git directory and README.md file from this repo. The theme installer displays errors if it does not find the standard directory structure.

## New Templates

You can create new templates as long as they reside within the standard directory structure.
