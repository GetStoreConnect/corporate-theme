## Directory Structure

This theme follows a particular folder organization. While some folders may not contain any files, they must still need to remain within the theme structure.

Also, it has been developed using the [Base Theme](https://github.com/GetStoreConnect/base-theme) as a boilerplate. The Corporate theme doesn't contain all the base theme structure, instead, we only include those customised, modified and new templates, snippets, variables or translations. Feel free to create a brand new theme using the base theme or this one.
